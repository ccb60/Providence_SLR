# Introduction
Here we prepare a graphic for depicting local sea level rise in Providence.  All
data is derived from NOAA Tides and Currents or COPS data for the tide gauge in
Providence, Maine.  Since NOAA provides clean data as monthly values, we need
only plot NOAA data, with minimal processing.

# Import Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

library(zoo)     # for the rollmean function

library(nlme)    # for gls

library(CBEPgraphics)

load_cbep_fonts()
```


# Import Data
Our primary source data is based on NOAA's analysis of sea level trends.  The
description on the source web site
(https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=8418150) says the following,
so this is apparently NOT raw data.

> "The plot shows the monthly mean sea level without the regular seasonal
fluctuations due to coastal ocean temperatures, salinities, winds,
atmospheric pressures, and ocean currents. ... The plotted values are relative
to the most recent Mean Sea Level datum established by CO-OPS."

For convenience, we want to be able to report these elevations as positive
values, which makes it easier for readers to compare elevations.  NOAA uses a
datum of MLLW for charting purposes.  We follow that practice here.

According to https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=8418150, 
at Providence, MLLW has an elevation (in feet) of 0.0 , while MSL has an elevation
of 4.94.  We can convert elevations in inches MSL to elevations in inches 
MLLW) as follows:  

$$
E_{MLLW} = E_{MSL} + (4.94 ft\times \frac{12 in}{1 ft})
$$
An alternative is to declare some other arbitrary sea level datum as a "Relative
Sea Level."  We prepare a graphic that way, below, but chose not to use it.

```{r folders}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

```{r load_data} 
fn <- '8454000_meantrend.csv'

fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

slr_data  <- read_csv(fpath, 
    col_types = cols(Year	= col_integer(),
                     Month = col_integer(),
                     Monthly_MSL = col_double(),
                     Linear_Trend = col_double(),
                     High_Conf.  = col_double(),
                     Low_Conf.  = col_double()
                     )) %>%
  rename(MSL = Monthly_MSL) %>%
  mutate(theDate = as.Date(paste0(Year,'/', Month,'/',15)),
         before = Year < 1956) %>%
  mutate(MSL_ft = MSL *  3.28084)
```

# Estimating the Linear Trend  
We use a linear model analysis to compare results to the linear trend reported
by NOAA on the source web page.  NOAA reports the rate of sea level rise in
millimeters as $1.9 \pm 0.14 mm /yr$.

The NOAA data are reported monthly, but to take advantage of the Date class in
R, we expressed monthly data as relating to the fifteenth of each month.  

As a result, our model coefficients are expressed in units per DAY. To find the
relevant annual rate of sea level rise, we need to multiply both estimate
(slope) and its standard error by 365.25 (approximate length of a year in days)
and then multiply again by 1000 to convert from meters to millimeters.

The estimate from a simple linear model matches NOAA's reported estimate, but
the standard error and derived 95% confidence interval are  considerably
narrower.  NOAA appropriately treated this as an auto-correlated time series,
instead of simply as a linear model. We do the same, specifying and
autoregressive error function of order 1.

```{r slr_gls}
the_gls <- gls(MSL~theDate, data=slr_data, correlation = corAR1())
ccs <- as.data.frame(summary(the_gls)$tTable)
EST <- round(ccs$Value[2] * 365.25 * 1000, 2)
SE <- round(ccs$Std.Error[2]   * 365.25 * 1000, 4)
CI <- 1.96*SE
tibble(Estimate = EST, Std_Err = SE, CI_95 =  CI)
```

Those results match the NOAA-reported estimate and 95% confidence interval.

# Mimic the NOAA Graphic
This a redrawing of the NOAA "Mean Sea Level Trend" graphic for Providence. I have
added a 24 month (2 year) moving average.  This is not ideal, as there is a gap 
in the data, and this graph eroneously connects those points, but it's a good
start.
## In Meters
```{r plot_slr_meters}
xloc = as.Date('1955-01-01')
annot <- paste(EST, '\U00B1', round(CI, 3), 'mm per year')

ggplot(slr_data, aes(theDate, MSL)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = before), color=cbep_colors()[1]) +
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(MSL,24, na.pad=TRUE), group = before), color=cbep_colors()[2]) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE, color=cbep_colors()[3]) + 
  annotate('text', label = annot, x = xloc, y = 0.15,  hjust = 0.25) +
  theme_cbep() + 
  xlab('') + 
  ylab('Monthly Mean Tide Level\n(m, MSL)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
 
ggsave('figures/providence_SLR.pdf', 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 3)
```
