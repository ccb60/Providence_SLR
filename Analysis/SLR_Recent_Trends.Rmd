# Introduction
Here we determine whether the data from the Providence Tide Gage supports the
idea that local sea level increases are accelerating.

# Import Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

library(zoo)     # for the rollmean function

library(nlme)    # for gls

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Import Data
Our primary source data is based on NOAA's analysis of sea level trends.  The
description on the source web site
(https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=8454000)
says the following, so this is apparently NOT raw data.

> "The plot shows the monthly mean sea level without the regular seasonal
fluctuations due to coastal ocean temperatures, salinities, winds,
atmospheric pressures, and ocean currents. ... The plotted values are relative
to the most recent Mean Sea Level datum established by CO-OPS."

```{r folders}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

The following generates many warnings about parsing errors, but all data
appears to be correctly imported.
```{r load_data} 
fn <- '8454000_meantrend.csv'

fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

slr_data  <- read_csv(fpath, 
    col_types = cols(Year	= col_integer(),
                     Month = col_integer(),
                     Monthly_MSL = col_double(),
                     Linear_Trend = col_double(),
                     High_Conf.  = col_double(),
                     Low_Conf.  = col_double()
                     )) %>%
  rename(MSL = Monthly_MSL) %>%
  mutate(theDate = as.Date(paste0(Year,'/', Month,'/',15)),
         before = Year < 1956) %>%
  mutate(MSL_ft = MSL *  3.28084)
```

# Estimating the Linear Trend  
We use a linear model analysis to compare results to the linear trend reported
by NOAA on the source web page.  NOAA reports the rate of sea level rise in
millimeters as $1.9 \pm 0.14 mm /yr$.

The NOAA data are reported monthly, but to take advantage of the Date class in
R, we expressed monthly data as relating to the fifteenth of each month.  

As a result, our model coefficients are expressed in units per DAY. To find the
relevant annual rate of sea level rise, we would need to multiply both estimate
(slope) and its standard error by 365.25 (approximate length of a year in days)
and then multiply again by 1000 to convert from meters to millimeters.

We don't bother to do that here.  Results match the NOAA reported SLR rate, if
you appropriately convert units.

The estimate, even from  a simple linear model matches NOAA's reported estimate,
but the standard error and derived 95% confidence interval are considerably
narrower. NOAA appropriately treated this as an auto-correlated time series,
instead of simply fitting a least squares linear model. We do the same,
specifying and autoregressive error function of order 1.

```{r slr_gls}
the_gls <- gls(MSL~theDate, data=slr_data,
               correlation = corAR1(), method = 'ML')
summary(the_gls)
```

Those results match the NOAA-reported estimate and 95% confidence interval, once
units are appropriately converted. (Not shown).

# Mimic the NOAA Graphic
This a redrawing of the NOAA "Mean Sea Level Trend" graphic for Providence. I have
added a 24 month (2 year) moving average, to help visualize temporal patterns.

## In Meters
```{r  plot_slr_meters}
ggplot(slr_data, aes(theDate, MSL)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = before), color=cbep_colors()[1]) +
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(MSL,24, na.pad=TRUE), group = before), color=cbep_colors()[2]) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE, color=cbep_colors()[3]) + 
  theme_cbep() + xlab('Date') + ylab('Monthly Mean Tide Level (m, MSL)')
```

# Reanalysis
We want to determine if the slope observed over the last ten, fifteen, twenty,
or twenty five years is statistically different from the long term trend or not. 

We explore several concepts of what might constitute a significant difference
is this setting.  We focus on examining the most recent 20 years, then explore 
other time scales.

1.  An ANCOVA-like model in which we can fit different slopes and intercepts above 
and below a "cutpoint."

2.  A piecewise linear analysis, in which we fit two slopes, but constrain the
solution to be continuous at the cutpoint (known here as a "knot").

3.  Examining recent slopes in the context of all slopes over similar length
periods over the period or record.

### Generate Cutpoints
We use these in the first two models.
```{r cutpoints}
span = 20
cutyear = 2019 - span

cutdate <- as.Date(paste0(cutyear, '-12-31'), format = '%Y-%m-%d')

slr_data <- slr_data %>%
  mutate(recent = Year > cutyear,
         older_date = if_else(! recent, theDate, as.Date(0)),
         recent_date = if_else(recent, theDate, as.Date(0)),
         recent_dt = if_else(recent, theDate - cutdate, 0))
```

## ANCOVA Model
Note that the default parameterization fits an intercept and a slope for the
reference level of the fitted factor (here, `recent == FALSE`) and then fits
corrections for slope and intercept for any other values of the factor.  So, the
four parameters of the model (in order) are:  
*  intercept  
*  correction to intercept for most recent period  
*  slope  
*  correction to slope for most recent period.  

The intercepts should not be interpreted directly, as they are for
`theDate == 0`, which in this context is meaningless.
```{r ancova_gls}
ancova_gls <- gls(MSL~recent*theDate, data=slr_data,
                  correlation = corAR1(), method = 'ML')
summary(ancova_gls)
```
Here, I pull the two slope parameters, and calculate the proportionate change in
slope implied by the model.  As the fourth term is a CORRECTION, the implied
slope is the sum of both slope terms.  We divide the "new" slope by the "old"
slope.
```{r}
cc = coef(ancova_gls)[3:4]  # slope and correction for more recent slopes
(cc[2] + cc[1])/cc[1]
rm(cc)
```
By this analysis, the recent slope is two and a half times the older
slope.  Adding the term to the model represents a significant improvement over
a simple linear regression. We can confirm significance by ANOVA.
```{r}
anova(the_gls, ancova_gls)
```

## Piecewise Linear Regression
The idea here is similar to the last, except that we fit a predictor that starts
at zero at the knot, and climbs parallel to the time coordinate. This
effectively forces a single change in slope at the knot, while ensuring the
prediction line is continuous at the knot.
```{r piecewise_gls}
piecewise_gls <- gls(MSL ~ theDate + recent_dt, data=slr_data, 
                     correlation = corAR1(), method = 'ML')
summary(piecewise_gls)
```

```{r}
anova(the_gls, piecewise_gls, ancova_gls)
```
This also shows a significant improvement over a simple linear model.

## Visualizing the Models
```{r  visualize_models, plot_slr_models, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(slr_data, aes(theDate, MSL)) +
  geom_line(color=cbep_colors()[1], alpha = 0.25) +
  
  geom_line(aes(x = theDate, y = predict(the_gls), group = recent),
            color = 'black', alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(x = theDate, y = predict(ancova_gls), group = recent),
            color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(aes(x = theDate, y = predict(piecewise_gls), group = recent),
            color = 'green4') +
  theme_cbep() + 
  xlab('Date') + 
  ylab('Monthly Mean Tide Level (m, MSL)')
```

## Cleanup
```{r}
rm(cutdate, cutyear)
rm(ancova_gls, piecewise_gls, the_gls)
```

# All Periods of A Given Span
We will estimate slopes from periods with a fixed `r span` span starting at
the beginning of each year, and see if the slope from the last `r span` year
period stands out.

Because we will have a limited number of potential slopes, and they are 
correlated, we won't conduct a formal statistical test, but this will provide
a sense of how unique the recent past has been.

This is slightly complicated, as we have a gap in data coverage.  We do not want
to estimate slopes from partial records, so we start with data in 1958, the
first complete year of the new perios.

```{r}
years   = 1958:(max(slr_data$Year) - span)
slopes  = numeric(length(years))
is_sigs = logical(length(years))

for (startyear in years) {
  #cat('\n')
  #cat(paste(startyear, startyear + span, sep = ', '))
  the_dat <- slr_data %>%
    filter(Year >= startyear, Year < (startyear + span))
  mod = gls(MSL~ theDate, data=the_dat,
                  correlation = corAR1(), method = 'REML')
  
  ind          <- startyear - min(years) + 1
  slopes[ind]  <- coef(mod)[2]
  is_sigs[ind] <- summary(mod)$tTable[2,4] < 0.05
}

slopes_df = tibble(years, slopes, is_sigs)
rm(the_dat, years, slopes, is_sigs)
```

```{r first_histogram}
ggplot(slopes_df, aes(x = slopes * 1000 * 365.25, fill = is_sigs)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = slopes_df$slopes[length(slopes_df$years)] * 1000 * 365.25) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  xlab('Slope  (mm/year)')
```

So, the current estimated slope is on the high end of the slopes observed over
all twenty year periods of record, but it is not the quite highest.

```{r}
slopes_df %>%
  summarize(cnt_lower = sum(slopes< last(slopes)),
            pct_lower = cnt_lower/ length(slopes),
            cnt_higher = sum(slopes >= last(slopes)),
            pct_higher = cnt_higher/ length(slopes))
```

So, the slope for the most recent `r span` year period is lower than only 2 of
the other `r span` year periods in the historic record.

```{r dot_plot, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(slopes_df, aes(x = years, y = slopes * 1000 * 365.25, color = is_sigs)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  #geom_hline(yintercept = slopes_df$slopes[length(slopes_df$years)] * 1000 * 365.25) +
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[4:5], name = "Significant\nTrend") +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  
  ylab('Rate of Change\nin Sea Level (mm/year)') +
  xlab('Starting Year of 20 Year Period') 
 
ggsave('figures/providence_SLR_changing_rates.pdf', 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 6, height = 4)

```
Most slopes are positive, and the highest slopes are recent.  I think it is fair 
to say rate of sea level rise is accelerating.

## Cleanup
```{r}
rm(slopes_df, mod, ind, span, startyear)
```
